// Snyk failed to read 1 or more manifest files.
// Sometimes things go wrong: a flaky connection, 3rd party services go down and Snyk is unable to read the files needed in order to test your project. 
// 
// If this happens, you could try:
// 
// - Opening and re-opening your Pull Request / Merge Request, to kick off a new test
// - Removing and re-adding the repo to Snyk
// 
// Ultimately, you should contact support@snyk.io if the issue persists
