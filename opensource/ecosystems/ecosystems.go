// NewOutdatedSDKVersionRequestedError displays errors with the following description:
// Snyk supports the latest channels of .NET which is currently [supported by Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet), but does **not** guarantee to support all SDK versions within each currently supported channel.
// 
// Within the supported channels, Snyk aims to support most, if not all, of the SDK versions currently released under the **newest** of the channels.
// 
// If the channels currently supported by Microsoft are `8.0`, `7.0` and `6.0`, Snyk **will** support all of the *latest* SDKs released for these channels.
//

// 
// If channel `8.0` is the newest channel currently supported, Snyk **cannot** guarantee that multiple, specific SDK versions for older, still supported channels such as .NET 6. 
// 
// ### Example support matrix
// 
// If:
// 
// * .NET channels currently supported by Microsoft are `.NET 8.0`,  `.NET 7.0` and  `.NET 6.0`
// * Newest SDK version under `.NET 8.0` is `8.0.203`

// 
// ### Workarounds
// 
// This limitation can lead to scan failures for customers that are pinning SDK versions in their `global.json` files without a [rollForward](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json#rollforward) directive, such as:
// ```json
// {
//   "sdk": {
//     "version": "6.0.101"
//   }
// }
// ```
// Since as `6.0` is not the newest .NET channel. 
// 
// To work around this issue, we recommend that customers employ some flexibility in their `global.json` file by employing the `rollFoward` directive to be `latestMajor`, as such:
// ```json
// {
//   "sdk": {
//     "version": "6.0.101",
//     "rollForward": "latestMajor"
//   }
// }
// ```
// 
// Which will allow Snyk to scan your code using a newer version of the SDK, despite your version pinning.
